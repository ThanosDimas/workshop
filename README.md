## EXPECTATIONS 

we want to have a fully working web application that will allow us to built our own burger and order it

## DETAILS FOR ITS UI 

1) login page

  Login page should have one input for username
  there will be two usernames with different permissions that each will show you different UIs
  
  i) admin
  ii) custom error
  iii) burger builder
  
2) admin page

  it will just show you the word admin so we know that permission is working
  
3) custom error page

  it will just show you an error because username doesn't match
  
4) burger builder page

  burger builder will have two parts.
  on the right side we will have all the ingredients of our burger with increament and decreament buttons
  while on the left side we will have tou burger buns and between this buns we will show with images all the ingredients the customer will   choose and the amount of them.
  in the bottom side we will have a button for procceeding the order
  there will be a checker there showing different messages for the amount of ingredients picked
  eg(too many ingredients -> 2 hours to create this burger you fat man etc.)
  
 ## TECHS
 
 This project must be constructed with react.js and typescript
 css will be ready for use
 images also will be there for you
 there will be a virtual server hosting an API with the ingredients
